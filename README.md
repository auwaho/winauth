# Windows Authenticator

This is a fork of the archived original WinAuth [repository](https://github.com/winauth/winauth) with fixes for authorization and trade confirmation.

The fixed 3.6.2 version is available on the [releases](https://github.com/auwaho/winauth/releases) page.

Requires [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) to run properly.
